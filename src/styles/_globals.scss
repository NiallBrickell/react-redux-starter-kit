------------------------------------
This file acts as a bundler for all variables/mixins/themes, so they
can easily be swapped out without `core.scss` ever having to know.

For example:

@import './variables/colors';
@import './variables/components';
@import './themes/default';
*/

// Globals - used to import all BASE vars - ie grid, colours, fonts etc.
// Much more useful to split this out so that we can only include what we need

@import 'grid';
@import 'colors';
@import 'fonts';
